# Mobile App Market Analysis

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook for the comparative analysis of mobile application data from the Apple App Store and the Google Play Store. The analysis focuses on free-to-download apps that generate revenue through in-app ads, with the goal of identifying trends and patterns that can inform strategic decisions in app development and marketing.

## Introduction

The project, titled "AppTrendz," aims to provide insights into user engagement and the popularity of various app genres. By analyzing data from both major app stores, this work forecasts which types of apps are likely to attract a larger user base and higher engagement.

## Datasets

The analysis is based on two datasets:

- `AppleStore.csv`: Contains data for 7,197 iOS applications.
- `googleplaystore.csv`: Contains data for a corresponding number of Android applications.

The key columns analyzed in these datasets include 'track_name', 'currency', 'price', 'rating_count_tot', 'rating_count_ver', and 'prime_genre'.
